# Hypothesis: Singapore is a great place to live or work.

## Analysis:
To assess the validity of this hypothesis, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using Power BI. We focused on various factors impacting quality of life in Singapore, particularly emphasizing the socio-cultural environment. By gathering and cleaning data from multiple sources, we identified key indicators and trends related to living standards, community well-being, and social support systems. We then used Power BI to create visualizations that highlighted these factors, providing a detailed overview of the socio-cultural aspects of living in Singapore. This helped us understand how these elements contribute to making Singapore a desirable place to live and work.

The data in a line chart shows that the populations of the three primary ethnic groups in a particular country have remained relatively stable over the years. However, in 2016, there was a noticeable increase in the Malay population, surpassing that of the Indian population. Additionally, when comparing fertility rates by ethnic group, Malays have maintained a steady rate of 1.8 for several years, while the Chinese and Indian populations saw a significant decline in their fertility rates, dropping to 0.98 and 0.99 respectively by 2020. This indicates a rising Malay population alongside a declining overall fertility rate in the country.

The data presented in the chart shows the highest level of education attained by individuals of different races in Singapore. Notably, the chart highlights the educational attainment of the Malay population. In 2015, only 8,100 Malays held a university degree. By 2020, this number had increased significantly to 14,200. This growth indicates the government’s commitment to promoting education and ensuring equal opportunities for all races in Singapore. The data underscores the success of the government’s policies in enhancing access to higher education for Malay individuals, which is vital for developing a well-educated and skilled workforce.

## Conclusion
- In conclusion, increasing support to lower-income households is a strategy to foster greater social fairness and inclusion for all races in Singapore. This can be achieved by expanding existing programs like Comcare or introducing new initiatives to provide more substantial financial assistance to those in need. By addressing socioeconomic disparities in educational and job opportunities, the government can help alleviate these gaps and promote a more fair and equal society for all Singaporeans.
